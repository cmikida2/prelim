\subsection{The Topic/Problem}

This section of the proposal targets a lack of high-order accurate and
provably stable interface conditions between structured and unstructured
meshes for computational fluid dynamic simulations. In particular, our aim
is to create a provably stable and accurate interface between summation-by-parts
finite difference discretizations (structured) and discontinuous Galerkin
methods (unstructured).  Achieving this would provide an option to create localized
areas of unstructured meshing (with superior flexibility for discretizing complex
boundaries/geometries) in existing simulations, providing an alternative to
overset curvilinear meshes.
